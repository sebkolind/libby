This is an opininated TypeScript Library starter template for those looking to get started writing a TypeScript library fast.
It relies heavily on the zero-low configuration that ðŸ“¦ [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) provides.

## Motivation

I build a lot of TypeScript libraries and tend to start new projects fairly often.
It got a bit tedious to set up the same project over and over, so I started this repository.
It is primarily for me, but if you find it useful, that's great!

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Parcel
- ðŸŸ¦ TypeScript
- ðŸ§ª Jest

## Usage

```sh
# Clone the template locally
git clone git@github.com:sebkolind/ts-lib-starter.git ./my-project

# Install dependencies
cd my-project
npm add
```

Now, you can use any of the `npm` commands:

```sh
# Devlopement
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test

# Build for release
npm run build
```
